# Workout Timer Development.

The app will be first developed on IOS Apple systems. The app may be later 
developed/ported to Andriod.

# Workout Timer:
1. The app will be a simple timer system. 
2. The app will give the user the ability to set the "Go" time and the "Rest" time. 
3. During a timing phase, the "Go" time will have a green background, with white text for the timer. During
the "Rest" time the app will have a red background, with white text for the timer

# CODE UPDATE 4/25/19:
1. Reform comments that are outdated. Specify updates below Description section of comments. Explain exactly what the additions do.

2. Review code for repetitive code which may be simplified.

# Current Progress:
1. ~~Create simple main page for the timer, icluding the timer/interval labels, buttons, and all other required media to funciton~~

  **COMPLETE**

2. ~~Implement ability to change the time to the users liking. Follow suit for the interval selection.~~

  **COMPLETE**

3. ~~Implement the timer. Get to a running state from pressing start. Ensure that user selected time is the countdown amount.~~

  **COMPLETE**

4. ~~Complete timer by adding pause/stop/reset buttons. Ensure that all button work properly before moving on.~~

  **COMPLETE**

5. ~~Consider the interval selection into the system. Every time interval is active show a "go", when not active show "rest" (better designs LATER)~~

  **COMPLETE**

6. ~~Implement designs in the app. Background pictures/colors, animated gifs for "go" and "rest" phases~~

  **COMPLETE**
  **NOTE:** Orginal gif design idea has been scrapped. Simply didn't look good with only being able to animate every 1.0 seconds. New design works and is smooth!
  

# NEW FEATURES:

1. Add 5 second countdown timer before each phase of "Rest" and "Go" begins. 
  **COMPLETE**

2. Add Sound which plays at each second of the above feature. 
  **COMPLETE / NEEDS TESITNG**
  
3. Add ability to select exercise interval time along with rest time. 

4. Conside adMob ads (at least for practice)
