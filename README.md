# Workout Timer Development.

The app will be first developed on IOS Apple systems. The app may be later
developed/ported to Andriod.

# Workout Timer:
1. The app will be a simple timer system. 
2. The app will give the user the ability to set the "Go" time and the "Rest" time. 
3. During a timing phase, the "Go" time will have a green background, with white text for the timer. During
the "Rest" time the app will have a red background, with white text for the timer

# Current Progress:
