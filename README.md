# Workout Timer Development.

The app will be first developed on IOS Apple systems. The app may be later
developed/ported to Andriod.

# Workout Timer:
1. The app will be a simple timer system. 
2. The app will give the user the ability to set the "Go" time and the "Rest" time. 
3. During a timing phase, the "Go" time will have a green background, with white text for the timer. During
the "Rest" time the app will have a red background, with white text for the timer

# Current Progress:
1. ~~Create simple main page for the timer, icluding the timer/interval labels, buttons, and all other required media to funciton~~

**COMPLETE**

2. ~~Implement ability to change the time to the users liking. Follow suit for the interval selection.~~

**COMPLETE**

3. ~~Implement the timer. Get to a running state from pressing start. Ensure that user selected time is the countdown amount.~~

**COMPLETE**

4. Complete timer by adding pause/stop/reset buttons. Ensure that all button work properly before moving on.

**IN PROGRESS**

5. Consider the interval selection into the system. Every time interval is active show a "go", when not active show "rest" (better designs LATER)

**NOT STARTED**

6. Implement designs in the app. Background pictures/colors, animated gifs for "go" and "rest" phases

**NOT STARTED**
